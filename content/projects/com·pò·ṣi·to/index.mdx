We built a basic recipe app that you can use to replace your family cookbook with some basic web-development skills.

## At The Core
At the core of all this it's just the basic web development elements of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Things that make it simple (We really like things like that)
ReactJS - A javascript library for building user interfaces. If you're learning web development these days you need to be aware of this awesome tech!
GatsbyJS - A React-based open source framework that optimizes performance, scalability, and security. It's blazing fast!

## Getting it out to the world
AWS Amplify - A hosting platform for building mobile and web apps. (#1. It's AWS, #2. It's simple, #3. It's AWS.)
