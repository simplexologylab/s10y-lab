You can give a drone to a 4 year old or 84 year old and you will receive the same ear-to-ear smile as they watch it take flight. As children we always imagine what it would feel like to fly and these tiny devices offer a glimpse into that possibility. The technology packed into these tiny devices is amazing and the avenues for learning are endless which makes this an excellent project for us to start with.

## Learning Areas

All of our projects are intended to spark an interest in various areas of technology and as we dive into the project we'll explore the following with the hope that its simple enough for anyone to pick up. We'll cover:
- 3D Printing
- Radio Controlled Motors
- Flight Controllers/Simulations
- Video Production/Transmission
