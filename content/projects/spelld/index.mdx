We built a basic app that provides students a way they can practice their spelling words.
- It randomizes the words.
- It disables auto-correct and auto-suggest.
- And if you're in the car (a good time to study) and your kid forgot their "spelling words", no problem. It's on your phone or their phone!

## At The Core
At the core of all this it's just the basic web development elements of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Things that make it simple (We really like things like that)
ReactJS - A javascript library for building user interfaces. If you're learning web development these days you need to be aware of this awesome tech!
NextJS - We tried NextJS this time around, stay tuned and we'll tell you what we think of NextJS vs GatsbyJS. Both are good and great things to learn.

## Getting it out to the world
AWS Amplify - We can't get enough of this. A hosting platform for building mobile and web apps. (#1. It's AWS, #2. It's simple, #3. It's AWS.)
